# October 2 2019 Meeting
## Foda, Varun, Shwetha, Shivani, James, Karthik, Joachim


## Goals of the team were discussed in detail

* To learn the basics of machine learning techniques 
* To become familiar in different machine learning libraries 
* To be able to develop an intution towards using appropriate algorithms for a given ML problem
* To be able to develop an application which incorporates all the learning

## Suggestions were exchanged to kick start the learning process

* Joachim suggesteed that we can start with scikit-learn and the we will discuss the overall outline of scikit learn.
* Joachim also suggested we start with an example, where it starts wih collecting the data, preprocessing the collected data, to develop different algorithms to train the model, analysing the training procedure in detail, finally interpreting the results.
* Joachim did volunteer to showcase the library scikit learn in the next meeting
* Google Colab was suggested to be chosen as an appropriate workspace. 



## Final Remarks 

* Scikit will be the library to begin with in our learning process
* Joachim will explain us the on what is Scikit learn API, and will explain the basic terminolgies and practises used in ML 
* James will show us useful techniques and commands in using Google colab (a cheatsheet to use google colab)
* Foda will show us how to make effective use of git hub (a cheatsheet to use Github)
