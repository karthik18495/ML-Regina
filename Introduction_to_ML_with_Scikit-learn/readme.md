In this folder we have introduction to ML using Scikit-learn. The series is divided in to five 
notebooks representing the various parts.

#### Part 1: Basic introduction to python
   In this notebook, we will go through the basics of pythons including
- Basic types
- Containers like list, dict, sets, etc
- Functions as well as function generators like enum, range
- classes and objects
- Reading and writing to files
    
#### Part 2: Numpy and Matplotlib for scientific computing and plotting respectively
In this notebook, we will go through `numpy` and `matplotlib` libray features which include
 - Creating and manipulating ndimensiona vectors
 - Getting statistics from vectors
 - Basic algebra
 - Vectorized computations
 - Basic 1D and 2D pltting
 - Customizing plots
 - Histogram plots etc
 
 
#### Part 3: Pandas for data exploration and manipulation
In this notebook, we will go through data exploration using pandas. The concepts covered includes
 - Creating Series and Dataframes
 - Manipulation of rows and columns
 - Performing basic stats
 - Using special functions play with the data held
 - Data visualizations with plotting 
 - Measuring correlation with confusion matrix
 
 
#### Part 4: Scikit-learn for machine learning
In this notebook, we will go through simple machine learning concepts as way to get a bit familia with 
Scikit-learn. We will cover
 - Types of machine learning
 - How does the full process looks like?
 - Getting data ( synthetic and toy data)
 - Train clustering algorithm on synthetic data
 - Data exploration of the Iris data set
 - Train a KNN algorithm on Iris data
 - Evaluate performance of a train model
 - Future propectives
